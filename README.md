## CSCI 2312: Programming Assignment 2

_operator overloading and linked data structures_

* * *

This program provides a class, Point, which represents points in n-dimensional space, and methods that can construct a Point object, set its coordinates, and do distance calculations on it. It also provides an unfinished implementation of a Cluster class which would represent a cluster of Point objects, but has no non-stub methods.

Currently, the main function is set up to do tests on the rest of the program. It uses the files ErrorContext.cpp, ErrorContext.h, ClusteringTests.cpp and ClusteringTests.h to do so.

### Compiler ###

This program compiles on Visual Studio 2015, but only if the function name __in is changed in Cluster.cpp and Cluster.h. The program was designed with the CLion IDE in mind, however.
